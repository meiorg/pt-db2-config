  # DB2 service
  # Note: "services" variable here is used to initiate private connection gateway between EASe Java and DB2
  # when both servcies are at private endpoints. But currently for pen test, we're using DB2 public endpoint (see db2HostName value below), 
  # therefore, this "services" variable has no effect.
